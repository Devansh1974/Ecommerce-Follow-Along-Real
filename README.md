# Ecommerce-Follow-Along

## Overview

Welcome to the Ecommerce MERN Stack Application project! This project is designed to help you learn how to build a full-stack e-commerce application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). You will gain hands-on experience by building essential features like secure authentication, REST API creation, and database schema design.
Key Features

This project will incorporate the following key features:
1. REST API Creation

    Learn how to build scalable and secure RESTful APIs to handle various functionalities, including user authentication, product management, and order handling.
    Each API will follow the standard principles of REST and provide endpoints that interact with the MongoDB database.

2. Authentication

    Implement secure user authentication using technologies like JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
    Features will include user registration and login, ensuring that only authenticated users can access sensitive application features.

3. Database Schema Design

    Design and create structured MongoDB schemas to store e-commerce data, including users, products, and orders.
    Ensure data is stored efficiently and can be easily queried to support the frontend application.

4. Backend Development

    Set up a robust backend using Node.js and Express.js.
    Implement server-side logic to handle API requests, manage user sessions, and interact with the database.

5. Frontend Development (React.js)

    The frontend will be built using React.js to ensure dynamic and responsive UI.
    You will be responsible for creating user interfaces that interact with the backend through API calls.
